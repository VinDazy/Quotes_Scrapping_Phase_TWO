The ones that stay with you through everything - they''re your true best friends. Don''t let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they''ll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can''t give up because if you give up, you''ll never find your soulmate. You''ll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn''t mean you''re gonna fail at everything.

She may not be thinking about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that she knows you can break—her heart.
